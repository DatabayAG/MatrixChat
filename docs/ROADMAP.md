# Roadmap

## Device verification

Devices have to be verified by another device,   
otherwise the new device is unable to read previous encrypted messages.

## Allow Enabling encryption
It's not possible to enable encryption using the API (meaning it's not possible to enable through PHP code).  
Encryption has to be enabled by a user in the chat (through the matrix javascript sdk).

Once enabled, encryption can never be disabled again.

## Styling/Design
Depends on customer requirements.

## Chat features (reactions, replies, mentions)
Depends on customer requirements.
